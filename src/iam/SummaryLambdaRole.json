/* For the Amazon Bedrock InvokeModel permission, a resource wildcard (*) was utilized 
specifically to support Cross-Region Inference. Cross-region profiles dynamically route 
prompt requests across multiple AWS regions to ensure high availability, minimize latency, 
and prevent throttling. Because the exact regional foundation model ARN changes dynamically 
depending on which AWS region actually processes the request, the wildcard was necessary to 
ensure the Lambda function could successfully invoke the model regardless of the underlying 
geographic routing. */
